# Energy Consumption Prediction
- The project seeks to predict the energy meter reading of buildings across four energy types â€“ chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters based on historic usage rates and observed weather over a one year time-frame.
- With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes hourly meter readings from over one thousand buildings at several different sites around the world including the following CSV files :
- data.csv
- building_metadata.csv
- weather_data.csv
